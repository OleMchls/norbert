# Norbert
Norbert is an MP3 player for kids based around a Raspberry Pi. In it's latest version, the MP3 player can be controller with five buttons on the front (volume up/down, pause/play, next/previous) and the albums are selected through RFID cards.

Here is a video demonstration of the whole project:
